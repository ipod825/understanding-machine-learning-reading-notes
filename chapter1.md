# Chapter 1 - Introduction

## What Is Learning? 
* Learning by memorization - **bad generalization**
* Inductive reasoning (inference) - better generalization
* Weakness of inductive inference - might lead to **false conclusion**
    * e.g., Pigeon Superstition Experiment - Pigeons associate food delivery time with whatever chance actions
* What makes a useful learning
    * e.g., Rats "know" that food cannot cause an electric shock, so their learning process is biased by ignoring some temporal correlations between events.
    * Bias (prior knowledge) is inevitable for useful learning - **No-Free-Lunch-theorem**
    * Trade-off between learn-ability (strong bias) and flexibility (weak bias)

## When Do We Need Machine Learning?
* Tasks that are too complex to program by hands
* Tasks that might change over time or from one user to another (e.g., speech recognition)

## Types of Learning
* Supervised/Unsupervised learning - whether the training data are labeled
    * Intermediate setting - Predicting more than the given labels. (e.g., Try to learn evaluation function of chess board with only process and the winner as training data.)
* Active/Passive learning - whether the learner interacts with the environment (posing queries or performing experiments)
* Helpfulness of the teacher
    * Helpful teacher - human learning
    * Adversarial teacher - e.g., spam detection; worst-case scenario
    * Random - e.g., scientists learning nature; building blocks of "statistical learning", which assumes data are generated by a random process
* Online/Batch learning - whether the learner should respond online


## Relations to Other Fields
* Difference from AI - emphasizing more on using strength of computer to complement human intelligence
* Different from statistics
    * Emphasize more on learning meaning pattern (hypothesis) than doing hypothesis test
    * Emphasize more on algorithmic issues, computation efficiency
    * Learning theory focuses on finite sample bounds rather than asymptotic behavior, i.e., infinite samples
    * Assumes as little as possible about the nature of data distribution
